Basic Setting
This is a simplified procedure of the turtlebot3 basic instructions. More detailed descriptions can be found here: http://turtlebot3.robotis.com/en/latest/index.html 




If you are NOT using virtual machine (eg. dual boot):
Connect to LAB WIFI, find the wifi: IU_ROBOTICS, password: robotics@!u
Otherwise if you are using a virtual machine (not suggested):
Connect to IU-Secure Also, for virtual machine ubuntu, you need to setup your non-virtual IP, so that you can ping your own machine from other machines, try this:
        https://askubuntu.com/questions/28901/how-to-configure-my-virtualboxs-ubuntu-ip 




In your laptop PC, do the following:


In terminal find your IP address using command: 
        ifconfig
should be something like: 156.56.xxx.xxx (lab wifi), or 149.xx…(IU-Secure)


In your PC, Open .bashrc (it is located in your home directory) 
        gedit ~/.bashrc (OR vim ~/.bashrc depending on your editor preference)
and edit it by appending the following lines. (Replace YOUR_IP with the real IP you found above)
        export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://YOUR_IP:11311
        export ROS_HOSTNAME=YOUR_IP
        export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle


Save and exit .bashrc and
        source .bashrc


In your PC, install the turtlebot catkin_ws packages, and compile them, following the WHOLE procedures of Step 5.3 of this page:
        http://turtlebot3.robotis.com/en/latest/pc_software.html
        
After installation, source the new setup
        Source devel/setup.bash


(Every time you open a new terminal and need to run launch file, you need to source the setup.bash)


----        
Get your assigned unique turtlebot (with the IP labeled in blue duck tape).
Open another terminal in your PC,  and SSH to the robot:
        ssh iurobotics@ROBOT_IP
with password:
        robotics@!u


In your SSH-ed turtlebot terminal:
find the .bashrc file, and modify the ROS_MASTER_URI :
Replace the ROS_MASTER_URI IP with your PC IP
        source .bashrc




Basic Operation:


Now let's remotely control the robot with your laptop:


In your PC, Run ROS core in a terminal:
        roscore


In your SSH-ed turtlebot terminal:
Source 
        Source devel/setup.bash
Bring up basic turtlebot packages:
        roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch


--
In your PC, visualize Lidar sensing in Rviz:
        roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_model.launch


--
In your PC, Keyboard tele-operation:
        roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch


--
In your PC, do SLAM:
        roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch


In your PC, Visualize the constructed SLAM map in Rviz:
        rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find turtlebot3_slam`/rviz/turtlebot3_slam.rviz


In your PC, If you want to save SLAM map:
        rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/map


--
In your PC, after you have obtained the SLAM map, you can try navigation:
        roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=$HOME/map.yaml


In your PC, visualize navigation:
rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find turtlebot3_navigation`/rviz/turtlebot3_nav.rviz
